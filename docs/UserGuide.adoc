== Introduction

ThanePark is for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing the rides in
your theme park!*. More importantly, ThanePark is *optimized for those who prefer
to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a
Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, ThanePark can get your
contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump
to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start
