== Overview

This portfolio is meant to document my contributions to this project Thane Park. +
Thane Park is a desktop application used for managing the rides and attractions in a theme park. The user interacts with
it using a Command Line Interface (CLI), and it has a Graphical User Interface (GUI) created with JavaFX. It is written
Java and has about 10 kLoc. +
My role in the project is to manage the tests and storage in the application. I've also added and enhanced a couple of
features, namely Filter and Find.


== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to filter data entries in the application*
** What it does: Allows users to filter entries based on the conditions that they can input.
** Justification: This feature significantly improves the application because now, users don't need to know the exact number
or name of the ride that they want. They can simple specify a range and then the application will provide a list of entries
that is within the range specified.
** Highlights: This enhancement involved introduction a new predicate class to allow users to input range
** Credits: _{mention here if you reused any code/ideas from elsewhere or if a third-party library is heavily used in the feature so that a reader can make a more accurate judgement of how much effort went into the feature}_

* *Minor enhancement*: added a history command that allows the user to navigate to previous commands using up/down keys.
