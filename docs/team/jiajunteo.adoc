= PROJECT: ThanePark

---

== Overview

This portfolio serves to document my contributions to ThanePark.
ThanePark is a project that I have done in my software engineering module(CS2103T).
It was done during the first semester of my second year in NUS School of Computing,
together with three other classmates.
It is a desktop application used for theme park operators to manage their rides.

A limitation set by the module is that the user has to interact with ThanePark using a Command Line Interface(CLI).
It also has a Graphical User Interface(GUI) created with JavaFX.
ThanePark is written in Java, and has about 10,000 lines of code.

My role in ThanePark is to implement the viewstatus status command to view rides of different statuses and to update documents.


== Summary of Contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added the `viewstatus` command
** What it does: allows the user to obtain a list of rides filtered by the statuses of the rides.
** Justification: Allows the user to find relevant rides with ease.
** Highlight: This enhancement involved introduction a new predicate class, `RideStatusPredicate`,
  to allow users to input a fixed set of statuses to compare values with the existing data.
** Credits: The view status feature is based on the way find feature works, with a `RideStatusPredicate` instead of a
            `RideContainsKeywordsPredicate`.

* *Minor enhancement*: added the `maintain` command.
** What it does: allows the user to change the status of a selected ride to `MAINTENANCE`.
** Justification: Allows the user to find relevant rides with ease.
** Highlight: This enhancement involved changes the status of the ride to `MAINTENANCE`.
  In doing so, the command also updates the maintenance and waiting time field to zero
** Credits: The view status feature is based on the way update feature works, ... ...
